// 1 - set g_pMixBufs to a pointer to a populated mix_s struct (that contains all your streams)
// 2 - set g_pSampleDst to the destination stream
// 3 - set g_uBytesToMix to how many bytes long all lines are (they all must be the same length).
//	IMPORTANT : g_uBytesToMix must be a multiple of 8, and must be >= 8!
// 4 - run g_mix_func() and you're done!

// we always want this function defined for the purpose of testing (releasetest.cpp)
