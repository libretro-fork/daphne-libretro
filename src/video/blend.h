// TO USE THE BLEND FUNCTIONS:
// 1 - set g_blend_line1 to the first line of bytes to be averaged
// 2 - set g_blend_line2 to the second line of bytes to be averaged
// 3 - set g_blend_dest to the line of bytes that will be the destination
// 4 - set g_blend_iterations to how many bytes long all lines are (they all must be the same length).
//	IMPORTANT : g_blend_iterations must be a multiple of 8, and must be >= 8!
// 5 - run g_blend_func() and you're done!

// we always want this function defined for the purpose of testing (releasetest.cpp)
